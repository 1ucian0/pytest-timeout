TODO
====

* Add proper tests

* Consider adding a funcarg which allows you to manipulate the
  timeout.

* Consider adding a mark which allows you to specify a timeout using a
  decorator in the same way as pytest.mark.skipif().

* If SIGALRM is used and the code under test can not be interrupted
  using an AsserionError then this fails to work.  So maybe consider a
  funcarg/mark to select whether SIGALRM or a Timer is used.  Or
  enable os._exit(1) for SIGALRM as well.

* Consider checking for an existing signal handler.  If it exists
  maybe fall back to the threading based solution.
